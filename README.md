# BOSTON_EDA
The inspiration for this project comes from the Boston Regression project. In the Boston Regression project, we identified the Top 5 most significant features affecting the median housing values, which are **RM, LSTAT, DIS, CRIM, PTRATIO**. This project seeks to dig deeper into the relationship between these variables and the median housing values.
